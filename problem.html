<!-- Short Introduction -->
      <p> While almost everyone in the world likes to dress fashionably and follow the latest fashion trends, we never look or even consider the downside of that. The fashion industry, especially the fast fashion sector that produces low-cost, quickly produced and low quality clothes that are not meant to last but instead to be thrown out and replaced shortly by new ones, negativly impact the environment in various ways. Now, you may ask yourself, how does my jeans or my shirt impact the environment, well let us tell you how ...</p>
<!-- First Problem discussed with data visualization -->
  <div class="firstproblem">
    <div class="firsttextSection">
      <p>First of all, the fashion industry has a high carbon footprint. It is responsible for 10% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, which is expected to rise to 50% in 2030, and by that the fourth most polluting industry. These gas emissions are caused by the immense amount of energy that is used for powering factories, storing clothes in warehouses and transporting them. But mainly the reliance on synthetic fibers and materials, such as polyster or nylon, is the problem. Synthetic fibers are made from petroleum, a fossil fuel which releases carbon dioxide when it is burned, are much cheaper than raw materials and are produced in large quantities, which explains the relaince on them. But they also require huge amounts of water and energy for their production. And as we will conclude from the following dashboard, the production of synthetic fibers just keeps growing and growing and almost 60% of all clothing materials are made from them. All of this means that the fashion indusrty contributes to global warming and with that to climate change, two major environmental problems nowadays. </p>

<!-- Second problem discussed with data visualization -->

        <iframe width="630" height="473" src="https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/reporting/7bbfaa45-06e2-483c-8971-a42d3d36e59c/page/SGiZD" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      <div class="secondtextSection">
    <p>Furthermore, the fashion industry uses up about 93 billion cubic meters of water annualy which are enough to meet the consumption needs of five million people. But not just that, it also pollutes the water in many many ways. Fabric dyeing and treatment is alone responsible for 20% of the worldwide wastewater. And the textile production generates 42 million tons of plastic waste per year which mostly ends up in our oceans and not just that but also, every time a synthetic garment is washed, it releases tiny plastic microfibers into the water and with that they spread in the food chain and endanger the wildlife and humans as well. 
</p>
        <p>Lastly, we cannot forget that the majority of the garnments end up un landfills or get burned in incinerators for energy recovery and either way they release harmful chemicals into the environment as they degrade or get burned and by that they contribute to the gas house emissions. The fashion industry produces up to 100 billion garments every year. And each year, as much as 92 million tons of clothing ends up in landfills and sadly only 20% of textiles are collected for reuse or recycling globally. </p>
