# Dress Sustainably
This repository hosts the coding project created for the KatyYouthHacks2023 and PeddieYouthHacks2023 hackathons called "Dress Sustainably". 
It aims to educate about the fashion industries' environmental impact and encourages users to switch to sustainable fashion.
## What is Dress Sustainably? 
As mentioned before, Dress Sustainably aims to educate people about the environmental impacts of the fashion industry. 
While almost everyone in the world loves to dress and follow new trends, we never realize how much these simple actions pollute and damage our beloved earth.
Dress Sustainably discusses the problem by using facts and data visualizations and suggests solutions like eco-friendly brands and textiles. 
We hope to raise awareness and be part of solving the problem.
