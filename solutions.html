    <p> Now, there are multiple solutions to this problem that can be easily implemented. All you have to do is start with yourself and understand the huge role you will be playing by just following these few tips. If each of us did his turn, then we will have a big impact on advocating for sustainable, eco-friendly fashion. </p>
<!-- Presenting the solutions -->
    <div class="solutions">
      <p> 1.Solution:</p>
      <p> To reduce the energy consumption and with that the greenhouse emissions, factories and warehouses should be using renewable energy instead of burning fossil fuels for energy.</p>
  </div> 
    <div class="solutions">
      <p>2.Solution: </p>
      <p> Sell, donate or bring your clothes to a recycling center instead of just throwing them away. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solutions">
      <p> 3.Solution:</p>
      <p> Buy recycled, upcycled, organic or sustainable clothing and try avoiding buying from fast fashion brands. Some brands are now making new clothing from post-consumer textile waste, or other waste items such as discarded plastic bottles or nylon fishing nets as others make stylish and durable garments from offcut fabric scraps and plastic waste. Also, be sure too buy a sustainable design that lasts longer and can be worn multiple times by possibly opting for high-quality fabrics, simple designs, and by avoiding trends. Another option is buying organic clothing as the farming therefor is based on using less water and energy than conventional farming as well as avoiding the use of synthetic pesticides. And by that, organic fibers do not contain any plastic which means they will biodegrade leaving no environmental impact.

        <h1> Hemp</h1>
        <p> Hemp fabric is eco-friendly and sustainable as its cultivation requires less natural resources and can clean contaminated soil. Furthermore, hemp can survive without pesticides, therefore its production is less damaging to the environment. Finally, hemp fabric is durable, long-lasting and biodegradable.</p>

        <h1> Recycled   Polyester </h1>
        <p>  Recycled polyester is a synthetic fabric, yet instead of using completely new materials to create polyester, this is created by recycling post-consumer plastic waste like plastic bottles. This is eco-friendly as it reinventes the nonbiodegradable materials that would otherwise 
end up in landfills or the ocean. Also, it decreases the greenhouse gases emitted when producing completly new polyester from fossil fuels.

        <h1> Linen </h1>
        <p>Linen is one of the oldest and most eco-friendly clothing fabrics there is. It is derived from the flax plant, a very versatile and sustainable crop. The plant thrives with minimal water and fertilizer as well as in poor-quality soil.
The flax fibers, natural, extremely strong fibers, can be processed into yarns for textile and clothing.
Finally, if it is untreated with synthetic dyes or inorganic chemicals, then it is entirely biodegradable.

        <h1> Piñatex </h1>
        <p>Piñatex is a vegan leather derived from pineapple leaves, a byproduct of the fruit harvest. 
The developer of this eco-friendly fabric is Dr. Carmen Hijosa, a Spanish leather goods expert.
Around 40,000 tons of pineapple leaves are discarded from the pineapple harvest every year and they eventuelly become organic waste and release methane, a greenhouse gas. So instead, Dr. Carmen decided to make use of it and by that also reduce the number of pineapple leaves sent to landfills.But that is not all as Piñatex has the potential to replace animal leather and is currently being used as an alternative by fashion designers. And since it is made from waste, it additionally helps conserve natural raw materials.
